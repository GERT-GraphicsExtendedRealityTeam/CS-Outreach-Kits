# Brunel-CS-Outreach-Kits

As the CS Athena SWAN outreach lead, I ran a number of different activities for schools and colleges to raise awareness of computing and its applications. My main goal is to inspire more women and girls into Computer Science. Activities range from talks at open days to hand on workshops on campus and/or at local schools. Some resources related to those hands-on workshops can be found below.
